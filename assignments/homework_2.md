# Write the letter of signifigance.

Imagine that you have a manuscript that you would like to publish (perhaps you even have a real manuscript).
Think through what your (possibly imaginary) results would be.
Select a higher impact journal from your field.

Write separately:
1. A significance statement (Explain the significance of the research at a level understandable to an undergraduate-educated scientist outside their specialty field. Include no more than 120 words).
2. A letter to editor describing your work. With the help of your significance statement, emphasize the importance of your work (Here, you may include more words than in 1). Do not forget to target the aims and scope of the journal in it.
3. For this exercise, do not use AI tools.
